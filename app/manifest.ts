/**
 * The web app manifest, which is what makes Livanta installable from the
 * browser: Android offers an install prompt, iOS offers Add to Home Screen,
 * and a desktop browser offers an install icon in the address bar.
 *
 * It has to live in the app directory rather than in public/ for one specific
 * reason. Next.js mangles filenames it does not recognise, so a static
 * manifest.webmanifest in public/ can arrive at the CDN as
 * manifest.webmanifest.txt and be rejected as the wrong MIME type. Generating
 * it through the Metadata API guarantees the exact path and content type.
 *
 * Everything here is served from the same origin as the app. There is no
 * start_url pointing anywhere else, because this app keeps all of its data in
 * the browser (IndexedDB) and has no server to authenticate against.
