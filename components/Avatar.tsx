/**
 * The user's picture, or their initials when there isn't one.
 *
 * Two things worth knowing about the markup:
 *
 * - The image is `alt=""`. The name is always rendered right next to it, so a
 *   labelled image would make a screen reader announce "photo of Temmy, Temmy".
 *   The picture here is decoration for a name that is already present.
 * - A stored value that fails `isAvatarDataUrl` falls back to initials instead of
 *   rendering. Settings can arrive from an export or a sync, and a broken image
 *   icon in the one place a person looks to confirm who they are is worse than
 *   no picture at all.
