 * been submitted to either store. Every download control reads from here and
 * renders a disabled "Coming soon" state when a URL is missing, so there is no
 * path in the code that can navigate a visitor to a listing that does not exist.
 *
 * When a store listing exists, set the value and nothing else needs to change:
 * the badges become live links, the QR code starts pointing at the real
 * destination, and the sticky mobile CTA opens the right store for the platform.
 *
 * Do not put a plausible-looking URL in here to make the page look finished.
 * A dead store link is worse than an honest "coming soon", because the visitor
 * only discovers it after tapping.
