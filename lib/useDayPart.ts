/**
 * The current part of the day, kept live.
 *
 * The greeting needs to follow the clock, so reading `new Date()` during render
 * is not enough: a tab left open from lunchtime into the evening would keep
 * saying "Good afternoon" until something else happened to re-render it. This
 * subscribes instead, and the greeting corrects itself on its own.
 *
 * Two details keep it cheap and correct:
 *
 * - The snapshot is the *part*, not the time. Re-rendering every minute to
 *   discover the hour is the same as now would be pointless work; this only
 *   changes when the answer actually changes, three times a day.
 * - It also listens for focus and visibility. A phone that sleeps through the
 *   whole afternoon has no timer running, so returning to the tab is the one
 *   moment we are sure the cached answer is stale.
 *
 * The clock is the reader's own, which is what `dayPart` reads. Nothing here is
 * persisted or synced: what time it is where you are standing is not data about
 * you worth uploading.
